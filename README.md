# Prompt Engineering
My experiments with prompt engineering to get the LLMs to do what I actually want them to do. Learning different styles of prompts, and creating a few template prompts that I can re-use for my main tasks (outlining, writing, researching, summarizing, coding, debugging, etc.)

The repository outlines the lessons from courses A. and B. I then apply those lessons to create custom prompts that automate my most frequent/time-consuming activities.
